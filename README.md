# Stroke Prediction
Predicting the likelihood of someone having a stroke based on certain pre-existing conditions using two machine learning models 

Project includes data cleaning(minimal), data visualization, and preprocessing the data as well as training, testing, and evaluating Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning models to predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke. 

Repository includes jupyter notebook, dataset, and power point slides used for presentation

Dataset acquired from [Stroke Prediction Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) on Kaggle
