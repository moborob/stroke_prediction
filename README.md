# stroke_prediction
Predicting the likelihood of someone having a stroke based on certain pre-existing conditions using two machine learning models 

Project includes minimal data cleaning, data visualization, and preprocessing the data as well as training, testing, and evaluating Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning models to predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke. 

Repository includes jupyter notebook, dataset, and power point slides used for presentation
